# National Parks Odyssey

National Parks Odyssey is an educational and competitive web application that gives users the ability to research and virtually visit each of the U.S.'s beautiful national parks! Win minigames to obtain as many National Park Collectible Cards as possible. Display your knowledge and skills to gain more points, and climb to the top of the leaderboard!

# Installation

Simply use `Node Package Manager` to install dependencies and get playing!

```bash
npm install
```

Google Maps components contain environment variables that have been hidden, but if you'd like to run the App, you can obtain your own free Google API key: 

[Google Maps Platform](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/embed/get-api-key)

# Usage
**Home** - Home is the landing page for the App. Here users can see all parks on the map, view the current standings in the leaderboard, view their collected cards, and choose a park to virtually visit. Be sure to log in with a unique username for all these features!

**Encyclopedia** - Navigate here to view information about each park, search and filter parks, and maybe plan a visit in real life! Make sure you study up, because you can't open the Encyclopedia during gameplay. No cheating!

**Rules** - Visit the Rules page for the general rules of National Park Odyssey as well as rules for each minigame.

**Games** - Click a park on the map to begin a random game for that park! Points are awarded based on time elapsed during gameplay. Win the game to collect your card and add it to your trophy case, or navigate back to the home page by clicking the NPS logo.
